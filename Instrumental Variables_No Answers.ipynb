This chapter explains how we can use Instrumental Variables Estimation to get a treatment effect using observational data.\n",

    "In this example, we use IV to recover the treatment effect in cases where random assignment is applied to an offer to participate, where not every participates (compliers AND never takers allowed!), and where other people participate through some other means. Specifically, we would like to evaluate the effectiveness of a financial aid offer on the likelihood of a student finishing 8th grade in Bogot√°, Colombia.\n",
