    "**Regression Discontinuity** is a method that makes use of a treatment applied at a cutoff point. It takes advantage of the fact that subjects at either side of the cutoff are not likely to substantially differ from one another on confounders. Thus, any difference in outcomes are only attributable to the intervention itself.\n",

    "In this notebook, we will learn how to implement and visualize a RDD design. We are using data from Joshua Angrist and Victor Lavy's \"Using Maimonides Rule to Estimate the Effect of Class Size on Scholastic Achievement.\" A common question in education and social science research is whether class size has an effect on student performance. At both the K-12 and university level, propnents of smaller class sizes argue that large class sizes cause teachers to divide their time and attention too thinly, and students suffer from the lack of individual attention. Moreover, large class sizes might be more distracting and impede student comprehension and achievement in a number of other ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, Angrist and Lavy make use of the fact that Israel implemented a rule that automatically split classes if they had more than 40 students. They compared student outcomes for students who were in classes with slightly fewer than 40 students to students who were in classes that were just barely split up. \n",
